I build data systems that go beyond storage and reporting â€” they are designed as living knowledge ecosystems. My focus is on creating Git-based, agent-maintained repositories of structured Markdown documents, combined with graph-driven navigation and semantic search. By integrated tools and automated pipelines, I aim to ensure that data is not just collected but actively curated, versioned, and enriched over time. The goal is a foundation that supports both human understanding and autonomous agent reasoning.
