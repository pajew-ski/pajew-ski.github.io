Home automation is more than convenience — it’s a framework for orchestrating an intelligent living environment. I develop integrations that connect Home Assistant with local infrastructure such as Proxmox, network mapping, and secure remote access, turning it into a unified control layer for both physical and digital systems. From automated Mermaid diagrams of network topology to advanced presence detection, my approach focuses on transparency, interoperability, and total user sovereignty.
