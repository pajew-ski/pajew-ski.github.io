Autonomous agents are the bridge between static systems and adaptive intelligence. I design and prototype AI agents that operate across APIs, file systems, and distributed knowledge graphs. These agents can update documentation, maintain workflows, generate visualizations, and continuously learn from new inputs. My work emphasizes modular architectures, clear operational boundaries, and self-healing processes, enabling agents to perform reliably in both experimental and production contexts.
